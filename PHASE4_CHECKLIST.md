Phase 4 QA & Improvements applied: 2025-09-09T09:13:54.269673Z

Applied changes:
- Added network timeout and error handling in lib/apiClient.ts
- Added CORS middleware and safer error handling in backend/app/main.py
- Wrapped Supabase calls in auth/contact/pricing pages with try/catch and user-friendly messages
- Added responsive navigation with a mobile menu (hamburger)
- Ensured buttons use explicit type where appropriate
- Added CI/CD workflows and deployment docs in earlier step

Remaining recommended manual checks:
- Run `npm install` and `npm run dev` locally; test auth flows and Supabase connectivity with YOUR env vars.
- Test OpenAI integration by setting OPENAI_API_KEY in backend deployment.
- Optimize images (compress) and replace <img> with next/image for automatic optimization.
- Add unit/integration tests; currently none are configured.
- Accessibility audit (axe).

If you want, I can proceed with image optimization and adding automated E2E tests (Playwright) in the next pass.
