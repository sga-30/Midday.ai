# Midday.ai Clone

This repository contains the replication of the [Midday.ai](https://midday.ai) website as part of the internship project. The focus of this phase is to understand and set up the site at hand and prepare the development environment.  
The project characteristics basically focus on how the running of the business, especially when it came to the bigger tasks it typically involves tracking time, sending invoices, etc, which are scattered across different platforms. I've noticed that large companies struggle to adapt and invent swiftly and efficiently.

## Project Goal  
The goal is to build a working clone of Midday.ai with similar structure, features, and design.  
- Phase 1 ensures a **proper context of the site** and sets up the **body of the project** for future reference.  

### 1. Website Analysis  
- Features:
    - Vault: Secure storage for important files like contracts and agreements, keeping everything in one place for easy access​.
    - Financial Overview: Track key financial metrics like revenue, profit and loss and expenses.
    - Time Tracking: Allows for live time tracking of projects to boost productivity and collaboration, providing insightful project overviews.
    - Invoice: An upcoming feature that will enable users to create web-based invoices, collaborate in real-time.)  
    - Animations and transitions.  
    - Interactive elements (forms, buttons, menus).  

- Identified **backend requirements**:
  - Authentication (login/signup).  
  - Data storage (user data, form submissions).  
  - Newsletter subscription.

### 2. Tooling Setup  
- Installed **Node.js** and **Python** locally.  
- Created **GitHub repository** for version control.  
- Installed **VS Code** with extensions:  
  - React snippets  
  - Bootstrapped project with:  
  - `create-react-app` (or Vite for a lighter setup).
